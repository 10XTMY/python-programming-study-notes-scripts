# Python Practice and Study Notes

## Overview

This repository contains my personal practice and study notes, as well as scripts related to Python programming. As someone who juggles multiple programming languages, I've found it invaluable to have a consolidated space to store these notes for safekeeping.

Working with various coding languages often leads to periods of time away from one or another. Having a go-to repository to brush up on the fundamentals can be incredibly helpful..

## Contents

The repository is organized into various folders and files, each focusing on different aspects of Python programming. Here's a general overview of what you can expect to find:

- **OOP**: Object-oriented programming in Python, including classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Fundamentals**: Python syntax, data types, and basic constructs to decorators, generators, context managers, and more.
- **Logging**: Basic usage, configuration, and best practices.
- **Threading & Multi Processing**: Functionality, synchronization, and best practices. 
- **Flask**: Boilerplate setup, routing, and basic usage including sessions, cookies, templates.
- **JSON**: Basic usage, serialization, and deserialization.
- **Django**: For an example of a Django project, see the Django Photographer's website repo: [Django Photographer's Website](https://github.com/10XTMY/pixfina)
## Usage

Feel free to explore the repository, use the scripts, and adapt the notes as you see fit. If you find any errors or have suggestions for improvement, your contributions are welcome!
